Projects
Server Monitoring Dashboard (Personal Project, 2024)
Developed a real-time server monitoring tool using Laravel for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and MySQL for data management. Enhanced with Prometheus and Grafana for detailed metrics visualization, tracking CPU, memory, and network usage. Deployed on a Dockerized Linux environment, boosting efficiency during my tenure at HostCreators.
GitHub Repo
Intranet Management System (TSS Group, 2024–Present)
Directed the creation of an intranet portal using PHP Symfony, incorporating Vue.js for dynamic features such as task management and document sharing. Integrated OAuth authentication, role-based access controls, and security system linkages, streamlining internal processes with automated reports and alerts.
E-Commerce API Backend (Freelance, 2023)
Constructed a RESTful API for a small e-commerce site using Golang and the Gin framework, supported by a PostgreSQL database. Managed inventory, orders, and payment integrations, optimizing performance with Redis caching for rapid response times. Enabled secure transaction handling for a local business.
Personal Finance Tracker (Academic Project, 2023)
Designed a web-based finance tracking application during my studies at Secondary Vocational School, utilizing C# .NET for the backend, Bootstrap for UI, and SQLite for data storage. Featured expense categorization, budget forecasting with charts, and secure login, showcased in my Microsoft C# certification.
Statistical Computation Library in C (Personal Project, 2025)
Engineered a high-performance C library for statistical computations, including robust linear regression, Mahalanobis distance-based outlier detection, and efficient Monte Carlo simulations. Leveraged SIMD for vectorized processing, integrated with Python via ctypes, handling datasets of up to 1 million entries with sub-second performance.
GitHub Repo
Fast Statistical API Service (Freelance, 2024)
Built a high-throughput REST API in Golang for statistical analysis, offering endpoints for ANOVA, correlation matrices, and bootstrapping. Supported by a custom C module for core calculations, deployed on AWS with auto-scaling, managing 10,000 queries per minute with 99.9% uptime for a research consultancy.
Advanced Graph Algorithms Optimizer (Academic Project, 2024)
Developed a C++ toolkit for optimizing graph algorithms, featuring a parallelized Bellman-Ford for shortest paths and an efficient Tarjan's algorithm for connected components. Included statistical profiling for performance analysis, applied in network simulations during my CCNA training.
Open Source Contributions

Enhanced a specialized C library for numerical linear algebra with optimized eigenvalue decompositions for statistical modeling.
Developed a Go package with custom Kolmogorov-Smirnov test implementations for statistical distribution APIs, shared on a personal fork.
Improved an open-source Python tool for stochastic process simulation by optimizing C-based random walk algorithms for financial modeling.
