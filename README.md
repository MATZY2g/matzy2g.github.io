School Projects

EDUWEB – Education Platform

As part of my Secondary School Activity (SOČ) project in my 3rd year of high school, I developed EDUWEB, a digital education platform originally designed for the subject Digital Communication. Over time, I extended the platform to support multiple subjects, making it a flexible tool for both students and professors.
Key Features:
- Professors can create and manage curriculums, exams, and tests.
- Built-in tools for student–professor communication.
- Multi-subject support for broader use across classes.
- Focused on usability and accessibility to enhance the learning experience.
The project aimed to modernize the learning process and provide a central hub for interactive education.


Interactive School Web Platform for Electrical Circuits

In collaboration with TUKE (Technical University of Košice), we developed a web application that allows classrooms to launch electrical circuits with a single click. The platform was designed to integrate with the Merito device from Ceelabs, enabling students and teachers to activate and manage circuits directly from the web interface.
Key Features:
- One-click control of classroom electrical circuits
- Integration with Merito for real-time circuit management
- Web-based interface for easy accessibility in school environments
