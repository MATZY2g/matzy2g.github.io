Projects
Server Monitoring Dashboard (Personal Project, 2024)
Developed a real-time server monitoring web application using Laravel for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and MySQL for data storage. Integrated Prometheus and Grafana for metrics visualization, allowing users to track CPU usage, memory, and network traffic. Deployed on a Linux server with Docker for containerization. This project enhanced operational efficiency during my time at HostCreators.


Intranet Management System (TSS Group, 2024–Present)
Led the development of a company intranet portal using PHP Symfony framework, with Vue.js components for interactive features like task assignment and document sharing. Implemented user authentication with OAuth, role-based access control, and integration with existing security systems. Improved internal workflows by incorporating automated reporting and notification modules.


E-Commerce API Backend (Personal Project, 2023)
Built a RESTful API for a e-commerce platform using Golang and Gin framework, with PostgreSQL database. Handled product inventory, user orders, and payment integrations. Optimized for performance with Redis caching and achieved low-latency responses through efficient query handling. This supported a local business in managing online transactions securely.
Personal Finance Tracker (Personal Project, 2023)
Created a web-based finance tracking app during my studies at Secondary Vocational School. Used C# .NET for the backend, Bootstrap for responsive UI, and SQLite for data storage. Included features like expense categorization, budget forecasting with visual charts, and secure authentication. Demonstrated as part of my Microsoft C# certification coursework.


Statistical Computation Library in C (Personal Project, 2025)
Implemented a high-performance C library for statistical analysis, featuring optimized algorithms for robust linear regression, multivariate outlier detection using Mahalanobis distance, and fast Monte Carlo simulations for hypothesis testing. Utilized SIMD instructions for vectorized computations to handle large datasets efficiently. Integrated with Python via ctypes for easy scripting, tested on datasets up to 1 million entries with sub-second processing times.


Fast Statistical API Service (Personal Project, 2024)
Developed a robust REST API in Golang for real-time statistical computations, serving endpoints for ANOVA tests, correlation matrices, and bootstrapping methods. Backed by a custom C module for core algorithms to ensure speed and accuracy on high-volume requests. Deployed on AWS with auto-scaling, handling up to 10,000 queries per minute with 99.9% uptime. Used for data analysis in a research consulting gig.


Advanced Graph Algorithms Optimizer (Personal Project, 2025)
Built a C++ toolset for optimizing graph-based algorithms, including a parallelized version of Bellman-Ford for shortest paths in dense graphs and an efficient implementation of Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components. Incorporated statistical profiling to measure time complexity under various loads. Applied in network simulation scenarios in CISCO simulations.
